# ARPro by Best Buy

This project was developed by Michael DeMarco and Liang Liu, and backed by a business model developed by Benji Li, Daniel Frydman, and Ophir Greif. It was built at BizHacks 2020, a business-oriented hackathon sponsored by Best Buy and hosted at UBC. My team and I developeda business solution for Best Buy, and took home the 2nd place prize out of over 50 teams.

The project allowed users to determine what product dimensions were right for them from the comfort of their own home. Not sure if a 60" or 62" TV is right for you? Use our app to increment sizes of a mock TV displayed right on your wall, courtesy of the latest AR technology, or do a side-by-side comparison, or even enter a custom amount of inches!

## Run the project

There are plans to release this product in some form as an APK file. For now, you can try it out by bringing it into Android Studio, and then following the instructions below to get ARCore to work.

### Import the Sceneform plugin into your project
Once installed, the Sceneform plugin lets you import, view, and build 3D assets in the Sceneform SDK for AR apps in Android Studio. It requires Android Studio versions 3.1 and above.

To install the plugin:

In Android Studio open the Plugins settings:

Windows: File > Settings > Plugins > Browse Repositories

macOS: Android Studio > Preferences > Plugins

Click Browse repositories, and install the Google Sceneform Tools (Beta).
